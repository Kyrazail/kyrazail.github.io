    Rudolf Schenker composed by 5 following members :

      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Schenker">Rudolf Schenker</a>, <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthias_Jabs">Matthias Jabsb</a>.
    Their first album was released in 1972. The band has had a worldwide prestige - especially from the 1980s
    - due to hard rock songs such as <span class="underline">No One Like You</span> in 1982 or <span
      class="underline">Rock You Like a Hurricane</span> in 1984 and ballads like <span class="underline">Still
      Loving You</span> in the same year or <span class="underline">Wind of Change</span> and <span
      class="underline">Send Me an Angel</span> in 1990, all of them almost systematically
    commercially successful. In the 1990s, with the decline of the media, the band turned to new experiences, such as
    <span class="underline">Moment of Glory</span> (with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra) and <span
      class="underline">Acoustica</span> (a live acoustic album), but returned to
    their traditional recipes in 2004 with <span class="underline">Unbreakable</span>, which was hailed by many fans and
    was followed in 2007 by the
    album <span class="underline">Humanity - Hour 1</span>. Since then, the band has sold more than 100 million albums
    worldwide. On January 23, 2010 the band announced on their official website that after their world tour accompanying
    the release of the new album, they will end their career, but in 2014, they decide afterwards to continue their career !
