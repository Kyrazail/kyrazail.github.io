            <h2>My routine</h2>
        </div>
        Hello, my name is Etienne PAQUELET, I am currently a student in BUT R&T at the MIT. I was born on March 21
        March 2004 in Clichy-La-Garenne (92). I have a little brother, a little sister, my parents, my grandparents
        some uncles and aunts. I lived about one year in Paris, then, I moved to Oyonnax because of my parent's work.
        My sister was born in 2005 in Romans sur Isère. 3 years later, my parents decided to move to Bourg en Bresse,
        again due to a transfert from my parent's work, and my little brother was born in there. <br>

        <b>Now, I will describe you may daily routine.</b><br><br>

        I usually wake up at 7 'clock, then I take a breakfast. For the breakfast, I often eat some bread with
        strawberry jam and an apple juice. At 7:45, I prepare my school bag, and I go to school. Before going to school,
        I'm always making sure that I have my appartment keys, else I can't open my studio anymore. Once at school, I
        discuss with my friends for about 5 minutes, then I follow the schedule of the day. The schedule of my school is
        the same everyday and it looks like the following.
        <br>
        <ul>
            - the class start at 8:00 am,<br>
            - the course lasts 1h30,<br>
            - We have 1h to eat at lunch<br>
            - The class start at 1:30 pm on the afternoon.<br>
            - The school day stop at 6 pm.<br>
        </ul>
        After school, I'm doing my homework. Around 7:30pm, i prepare the dinner, which is composed with vegetables,
        some meat sometimes. I usually eat while watching a movie, mostly an action one.
        After dinning, I continue my homework until 9:30pm, then i start playing at video games.
        Around midnight, i go to sleep

        <br><br><b>What do I like</b><br><br>

        Once a week, I go to my tenis class, which lasts 1:30. I'm playing tenis since 10 years ago. I'm a musician, I'm
        playing guitar since I'm 8 and i usually play some Metallica's song such as Nothing Else Matter, Master of
        Puppet, Unforgiven.

        <br><br><b>What do I want to do later</b><br><br>
        Later, I want to go to a cybersecurity engineer school. Then, I'd like to become an engineer in cybersecurity.

        <br><br><b>Extraordinary thing that I lived</b><br><br>
